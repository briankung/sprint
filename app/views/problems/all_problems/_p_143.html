<div class="problem-name">Investigating the Torricelli point of a triangle</div>
<div class="problem-content">
<p>Let ABC be a triangle with all interior angles being less than 120 
degrees. Let X be any point inside the triangle and let XA = p, XC = q, 
and XB = r.</p>
<p>Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of X such that p + q + r was minimised.</p>
<p>Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles AOB, BNC 
and AMC are constructed on each side of triangle ABC, the circumscribed 
circles of AOB, BNC, and AMC will intersect at a single point, T, inside
 the triangle. Moreover he proved that T, called the Torricelli/Fermat 
point, minimises p + q + r. Even more remarkable, it can be shown that 
when the sum is minimised, AN = BM = CO = p + q + r and that AN, BM and 
CO also intersect at T.</p>

<p>If the sum is minimised and a, b, c, p, q and r are all positive 
integers we shall call triangle ABC a Torricelli triangle. For example, a
 = 399, b = 455, c = 511 is an example of a Torricelli triangle, with p +
 q + r = 784.</p>
