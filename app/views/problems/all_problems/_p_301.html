<p><i>Nim</i> is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players 
take it in turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no 
stones remain.</p>

<p>We'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as follows:<br>
- At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.<br>
- On his turn the player removes any positive number of stones from any single heap.<br>
- The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.</p>

<p> If (<var>n</var><sub>1</sub>,<var>n</var><sub>2</sub>,<var>n</var><sub>3</sub>) indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size <var>n</var><sub>1</sub>, <var>n</var><sub>2</sub> and <var>n</var><sub>3</sub> then there is a simple function <var>X</var>(<var>n</var><sub>1</sub>,<var>n</var><sub>2</sub>,<var>n</var><sub>3</sub>) — that you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself — that returns:
</p>
<ul>
<li>zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually lose; or</li>
<li>non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually win.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example <var>X</var>(1,2,3) = 0 because, no matter what the 
current player does, his opponent can respond with a move that leaves 
two heaps of equal size, at which point every move by the current player
 can be mirrored by his opponent until no stones remain; so the current 
player loses. To illustrate:<br>
- current player moves to (1,2,1)<br>
- opponent moves to (1,0,1)<br>
- current player moves to (0,0,1)<br>
- opponent moves to (0,0,0), and so wins.</p>

<p>For how many positive integers <var>n</var> <img src="/files/symbol_le.gif" alt="≤" style="vertical-align:middle;" border="0" height="12" width="10"> 2<sup>30</sup> does <var>X</var>(<var>n</var>,2<var>n</var>,3<var>n</var>) = 0 ?
