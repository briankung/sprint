<div class="problem-name">Tri-colouring a triangular grid</div>
<div class="problem-content">
<p>Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:</p>


<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/files/p_189_grid.gif" alt=""></div>

<p>We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three 
colours: red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have 
the same colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two 
triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share an edge.<br>
Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.</p> 

<p>For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/files/p_189_colours.gif" alt=""></div>

<p>A colouring C' which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection is considered <i>distinct</i> from C unless the two are identical.</p>

<p>How many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?</p>
