<div class="problem-name">Chip Defects</div>
<div class="problem-content">
<p>
<var>k</var> defects are randomly distributed amongst <var>n</var> 
integrated-circuit chips produced by a factory (any number of defects 
may be found on a chip and each defect is independent of the other 
defects).
</p>
<p>
Let p(<var>k,n</var>) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least 3 defects.<br>
For instance p(3,7) <img src="/files/symbol_asymp.gif" alt="≈" style="vertical-align:middle;" border="0" height="9" width="11"> 0.0204081633.
</p>
<p>
Find p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghij
