<div class="problem-content">
<p>"<i>The Chase</i>" is a game played with two dice and an even number of players.</p>

<p>The players sit around a table; the game begins with two opposite 
players having one die each. On each turn, the two players with a die 
roll it.<br>
If a player rolls a 1, he passes the die to his neighbour on the left; 
if he rolls a 6, he passes the die to his neighbour on the right; 
otherwise, he keeps the die for the next turn.<br>
The game ends when one player has both dice after they have been rolled and passed; that player has then lost.</p>

<p>In a game with 100 players, what is the expected number of turns the game lasts?</p>
<p>Give your answer rounded to ten significant digits.</p>
