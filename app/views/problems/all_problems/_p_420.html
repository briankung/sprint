<p>A <i>positive integer matrix</i> is a matrix whose elements are all positive integers.<br>
Some positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a 
positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:</p>

</div>

<p>
We define F(<var>N</var>) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which have a <dfn title="the sum of the elements on the main diagonal">trace</dfn> less than <var>N</var> and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways.<br>
We can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.

<p>
Find F(10<sup>7</sup>).
