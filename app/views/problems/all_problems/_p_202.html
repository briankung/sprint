<p>Three mirrors are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, 
with their reflective surfaces pointing inwards. There is an 
infinitesimal gap at each vertex of the triangle through which a laser 
beam may pass.</p>

<p>Label the vertices A, B and C. There are 2 ways in which a laser beam
 may enter vertex C, bounce off 11 surfaces, then exit through the same 
vertex: one way is shown below; the other is the reverse of that.</p>

<p>There are 80840 ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex C, bounce off 1000001 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex.</p>

<p>In how many ways can a laser beam enter at vertex C, bounce off 12017639147 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex?</p>
