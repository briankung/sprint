				<h1>The Project Euler Sprint Hack Nights</h1>

				<p>
					Project Euler Sprint Hack Nights are beginner friendly events where you can work on your own projects or engage in a friendly competition called the Project Euler Sprint.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Project Euler Sprint is a friendly competition involving solving Project Euler (<a href="http://projecteuler.net/problems">http://projecteuler.net</a>) problems for points. Project Euler is a series of increasingly difficult computational math problems that must be solved with code (generally speaking - we've had some impressive solutions in pen and paper as well as on an Excel spreadsheet).
				</p>

				<p>
					Each problem is harder than the last, so each problem is worth its problem number in points. Problem #1 is easy, so it's worth 1 point, while problem #50 is much harder, but worth 50 points. You can form teams of 4 people and solutions can be in any language as long as it's coded there. More detailed rules below.
				</p>

				<h2>Project Euler Sprint: Rules</h2>

				<p>
					The Project Euler Sprint is a competition in which teams complete computational math problems from Project Euler. Starting with problem #1, each successive problem is harder than the last. Consequently, each problem has a point value equal to its problem number. Points are tallied up at the end of the event and the team with the most points wins.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Problems come from <a href="http://projecteuler.net/problems">Project Euler</a></li>
					<li>Solutions are worth their problem number in points.</li>
					<li>Solutions must be coded at the event. 
					<em>Mathematics libraries with methods for prime, factorial, fibonacci numbers, or other methods that make solving a particular problem trivial are not allowed. Those methods must be implemented by the team during the hack night.</em></li>
					<li>Solutions may be in any language.</li>
					<li>Problems may be done in any order.</li>
					<li>You may practice ahead of time.</li>
					<li>Each solution must be checked in* with an event organizer to count toward a team's point total.</li>
					<li>Teams may consist of up to four people.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>
					* Check ins involve showing the code, running it to produce a solution, and showing that the solution is correct on the Project Euler site. This means there needs to be at least one person per team who has a ProjectEuler.net account (sign up <a href="https://projecteuler.net/register">here</a>).
